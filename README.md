<h1>How does this work</h1>
<br>
Since AltStore v1.2 you can sideload unc0ver but nothing else, that's kinda not true i found out that altstore detects unc0ver with the bundle id, so i can change any app .ipa bundle id to the unc0ver app bundle id and it will work with AltStore, but of corse i has some limit's
<br>
<br>
<h1>Limit's</h1>
<br>
- You only can use one app with this if you want a another app you need to delete the old one
<br>
- Some Apps don't work even you changed the bundle id
<br>
- Riley could patch this (i don't think he will do it, but he can)
